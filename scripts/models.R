# Question 1 ----

#i want to know whether populations that have high underlying defenses invest more or less in induced defenses

#Response variable: each glucosinolate compounds (indoles most inducible, I3m & Indole)
#Fixed effects:  treatment (categorical), elevation (continuous)
#Random effects: population, rack
#ANOVA: differences between intercepts of treatment lines & slope of the line
#If hypothesis is true, both slopes will be positive, the induced line will have a steeper slope than the control line across elevations, and the induced line will be above the control line. At high elevations, they should be significantly different, but may not be significantly different at low elevations. Populations at high elevations should have higher overall levels of the compound than lower elevations

# growth-defense trade-offs & association with environment

#Fixed effects: growth x elevation
#Random effects: population, rack
#Statistical test - report slope of the regression line - r, r2, and p value
#If hypothesis is supported, positive slope across populations, populations that have higher biomass will have higher defense investment. The effect size of the slop should be bigger than 0.
